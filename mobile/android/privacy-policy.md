# Privacy Policy

Guillaume Vincent built the LessPass app as a Free app. This SERVICE is provided by Guillaume Vincent at no cost and is intended for use as is.
This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use my Service.
If you choose to use my Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. The Personal Information that I collect is used only to connect to the Service. I will not use or share your information with anyone.
The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions, which is accessible at LessPass unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy.
## Information Collection and Use
For a better experience, while using our Service, I may require you to create an account on https://www.lesspass.com. The account creation required an email and a password. The information that I request will be retained by us and used as described in this privacy policy.
The account creation is not mandatory to use our Service.

The app does not use third party services.

## Security
I value your trust in providing us with your Personal Information, thus we are striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot guarantee its absolute security.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy
I may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.
